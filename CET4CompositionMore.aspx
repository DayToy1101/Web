        Is A Test of Spoken English Necessary?<br />
        A test of spoken English will be included as an optional (component of the College
        English Test (CET). Some people contend that it is absolutely necessary to hold
        a test of spoken English in China because we have been told many times that a Chinese
        student who has been learning English for years cannot communicate with a native
        English speaker. Sometimes even those top students who excel at grammar and writing
        skills find their English inadequate to express their thoughts freely when speaking.
        A test of spoken English will bring the importance of speaking English to the awareness
        of the college students, and thus help them with their communicating skills.<br />
        On the other hand, there are also people who maintain that good reading and writing
        skills would be enough for the average English learners. College students are already
        under considerable pressure from their coursework. Another required test will only
        add to their burden. Also, some students may take the shortcut and only practice
        the questions according to the fixed format of the test, which will not actually
        improve their spoken English.
        <br />
        I believe that a test of spoken English will do more good than harm. Since China
        will continue its policy of opening and reform, the ability to speak fluent English
        is a must for anyone who wants to surpass others in a highly competitive society.
        Whether I take the test or not, I shall make all efforts to practice my spoken English
        in the rest years in college.<p>

            How to Succeed in a Job Interview?<br />
            Nowadays, in an ever tighter job market, great importance has been attached to an
            interview by both the employer and the applicant. The interview, so to speak, has
            become indispensable for getting a satisfactory job. On the one hand, the interviewer
            can take advantage of the occasion to learn about the candidates, such as their
            work experiences, education and their personalities, so as to pick out the right
            person for the company. On the other hand, the interviewee can make use of the opportunity
            to get to know the job he is going to take up, the salary, the working conditions
            and many other things about the job he is interested in.<br />
            Therefore, the job interview is very important to a job-hunter. But how can one
            succeed in it?<br />
            Firstly of all, the interviewee must pay attention to his or her appearance. The
            first impression is always where we start. Get dressed properly and neatly. Secondly,
            good manners are equally important. Don’t be too proud, and neither too timid. Just
            be courteous. Thirdly, the interviewee must demonstrate his aptitude and skills
            for the job and his knowledge about eh job-related areas. Be confident. Last but
            not the least, the interviewee ought to be honest about his or her personal as well
            as academic background, for honesty is the best policy.<br />
            To sum up, the job interview is indeed important, but there is no need to be nervous.
            As long as the interviewee has the ability for the job, with careful preparation
            and a fairly confident and honest performance, his or her success can be ensured.</p>

            A letter to a Schoolmate<br />
            Dear Xiao Wang,<br />
            I’m delighted to learn that you are going to visit me during the week-long vacation.
            My parents will also be happy to see you again. I’m sure you will enjoy every minute
            here.
            <br />
            I know you are fond of swimming. A river lies not far away from my home. We can
            go swimming there. I think it would be very pleasant and refreshing to swim in such
            hot summer days. In every big room of my home there is an air-conditioner. We can
            watch TV, play CDs or read books very comfortably at home.<br />
            A mountain about two miles away from here is beautiful and it is worth touring.
            We can go there on foot. When we climb to the top of the mountain, we can have a
            wonderful bird-eye view of the whole village.<br />
            Just phone me before you set off. There is no need for you to take anything. I’ll
            prepare everything for you.<br />
            I am looking forward to seeing you soon.</p>

            A Letter to the University President about the Canteen Service on Campus<br />
            January 12th, 2002<br />
            Dear Mr. President,<br />
            I’m very lucky to attend this world-famous university, but I’m afraid I’m not content
            with the canteen service on campus.<br />
            Firstly, the quality of the dishes should be improved. Undoubtedly, there are a
            lot of delicious dishes, but all the year round, they are the same. More and more
            students are complaining about eating the same food each day. So I think the most
            urgent problem is variety.<br />
            Secondly, the price is a bit too high. Many of us hope that the canteen can provide
            us with not only delicious but also cheaper food.<br />
            Finally, the environment is so noisy that we can’t enjoy our meals in good mood.
            I suggest that there be some soft music to help us relax.<br />
            These suggestions are not just of my own, but also of may other students. We hope
            our respectable president will pay attention to our suggestions.<br />
            By the way, the canteen workers are very patient and always smiling. So I think
            if our university offers them better conditions, they will offer us better service.<br />
            Best wishes,
            <br />
            Yours sincerely,<br />
            Liming</p>

            Student Use of Computers<br />
            Students tend to use computers more and more nowadays. Reading this chart, we can
            find that the average number of hours a student spends on the computer per week
            has increased sharply. In 1990, it was less than 2 hours; and in 1995, it increased
            to almost 4 hours; while in 2000, the number soared to 20 hours.<br />
            Obviously computers are becoming more and more popular. There are several reasons
            for this. First, computers facilitate us in more aspects of life. Also, the fast
            development of the Internet enlarges our demands for using computers. We can easily
            contact with friends in remote places through the Internet. Besides, the prices
            of computers are getting lower and lower, which enables more students to purchase
            them.<br />
            Along with the time spent on computers, there arise some problems. The most serious
            one is that many students are spending so much time playing PC games so that they
            ignore their studies. It is urgent to let the students use computers in a proper
            way.</p>

            It pays to Be Honest<br />
            Although honesty is believed to be a virtue, there are still dishonest people in
            our society. For example, some businessmen sell fake product to their consumers;
            some students cheat in the exams.<br />
            Dishonest people are short-sighted. Those who sell fake products may make money
            at first, but consumers won’t buy their products any more. As a result, they will
            lose their fortune or even be sent to prison. By contrast, honest people gain a
            lot.
            <br />
            Those who always tell truth or keep to their promise not only let others trust them
            but gain respect from other people as well. Such persons are sure to have a lot
            of good friends. Because they are trustable and respectable, everyone is eager to
            make friends with them, Besides, it is easier for a person with a good record to
            get a good job. Generally speaking, every employer wants his employees to be honest.
            So we can say that anyone who is honest will be paid back later.
            <br />
            In a word, honesty wins trust, respect and honor. So it is important that we should
            be honest.

            An Eye-Witness Account of a Traffic Accident<br />
            My name is Liming. I am studying at college. A week ago I saw a traffic accident,
            which is still vivid in my mind.
            <br />
            It was at about 9:00 on Saturday morning, June 15th, when I went out of the university
            to visit a friend of mine at another university. I was walking leisurely on the
            sidewalk when I heard a loud crash of two vehicles just at the T-junction about
            10 meters away. Two taxis crashed together. It was a traffic
