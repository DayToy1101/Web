            范文：<br />
            My name is Liming. I am studying at college. A week ago I saw a traffic accident
            , which is still vivid in my mind.<br />
            It was at about 9:00 on Saturday morning, June 15th, when I went out of the university
            to visit a friend of mine at another university. I was walking leisurely on the
            sidewalk when I heard a loud crash of two vehicles just at the T-junction about
            10 meters away. Two taxis crashed together. It was a traffic accident.
            <br />
            I went up and found that the two taxis were badly damaged. Both hoofs were out
            of shape. One door of a car was knocked off and lying on the road. One driver was
            blooding and another was shut in the taxi. Some people were trying to help the driver
            get out of the damaged car. One man was calling to the traffic policeman station.
            A lot of cars were jammed on the road.<br />
            From the stopping track on the road, it is clear that the two taxis were driving
            too fast. But it is just one of the reasons. In my opinion, the taxi drivers are
            eager to take more passengers and make a little more money. On the other hand, both
            drivers don't show concern for one another. Both of them wanted to run in front
            of another. Therefore, the accident is inevitable. So far, we should let the drivers
            keep it in their mind that a little slower, a little safer. Taking care of other's
            lives means taking care of your own life.</span><br />
